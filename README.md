Project: Farmlink - Automation and Monitoring System for Indoor Farming
Description: Developed an innovative automation system to optimize indoor farming conditions using ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors. The system automates tasks like irrigation and lighting, monitors environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, CO2, light, soil pH), and provides real-time data analytics via a cloud-based Android application.
Team Members: Farwesh K N, Arun M, Lathangi E, Rajaveeni S,Jayasuryan N and Vishwath J.H
Technologies Used: ESP32 microcontroller, sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2, light, soil pH), 4-channel relay module, Firebase for cloud integration, Android application for monitoring.
Impact: Improved yield and efficiency in indoor farming by minimizing manual labor, ensuring optimal growing conditions, and enabling precise control and real-time monitoring through automation.
